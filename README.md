Yet another PDP-8 emulator, the main purpose is to 
teach me more about the architecture. The main design 
goal is to separate the emulation from I/O through a 
serial interface so the emulator can be run on a 
microcontroller and remotely operated.

Emulated devices:
* KK8E
* KM8E
* KL8E

Just some documentation
